
Expense Tracker App
● Data Involved: Expenses with Data/SQL attributes like ID, category (food,
transportation, bills), amount, date, and description.
● Operations: Add, delete, update expenses or otherwise known as CRUD to categorize
expenses, and generate reports (e.g., total monthly spending).
● Data Structures: HashMap (for category-based storage), ArrayList (to store expenses),
Queue (for tracking recent expenses).

My Report
I plan to develop an Expense Tracker Application that allows users to log, categorize, and
analyze their spending. I plan for the application to involve several types of data, including
expenses, which consist of attributes such as an expense ID, category (e.g., food, transportation,
bills), amount, date, and description. Additionally,I plan to implement a bonus feature for budget
limits per category and monthly summaries to provide insights into spending habits. To
efficiently manage these data types, I will use a HashMap for quick category-based lookups, an
ArrayList to store and iterate through expense records, and a Queue to track recent transactions.
The application will support operations such as adding new expenses, updating or deleting
expenses, filtering expenses by category or date, calculating total expenditures.
